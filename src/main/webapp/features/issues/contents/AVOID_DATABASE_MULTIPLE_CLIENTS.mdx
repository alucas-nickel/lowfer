## Avoid database with multiple clients

A service may consist of multiple processes that will always be developed and deployed together,
such as an application process and a database that's only used by that service.

Keep each service’s persistent data private to that service and accessible only via its API.
A service’s transactions should only involve its database.

If there is a need to access a database used by *an other* service (for SQL transactions for example),
it might be a sign that there is an issue with the services' size / boundaries.
