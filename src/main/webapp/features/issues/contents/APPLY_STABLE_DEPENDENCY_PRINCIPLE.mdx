## Apply the Stable Dependencies Principle

Less stable components should depend on more stable components.

"Stability" is the amount of work to make a change.

Components that are heavily depended on (say, a logging framework) are very stable, because itâ€™s difficult to change.
Components that rely on many other components are highly volatile (for example, a UI or service layer).

```
Stability = 1 - Instability
Instability = Fan out / (Fan in + Fan out)
Fan Out = Outgoing Dependencies
Fan In = Incoming Dependencies
```

To avoid this, apply the [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle).
