## Apply the Rule of Three

Rule of three ("Three strikes and you refactor") is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when similar
pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication.

Libraries used by less than 3 components might have been designed "too early"
and create more problems than they resolve.
