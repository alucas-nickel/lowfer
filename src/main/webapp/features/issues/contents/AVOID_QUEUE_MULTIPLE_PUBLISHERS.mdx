## Avoid queue with multiple publishers

A useful principle is to assign responsibility for propagating events of a specific type,
to a single component: a single writer.

So the Stock Service would own how the ‘Inventory of Stock’ progresses forward over time,
the Orders Service would own Orders, etc.

This helps funnel consistency, validation and other ‘write path’ concerns through a single code path
(although not necessarily a single process).

Assigning responsibility for event propagation is important because these aren’t just ephemeral events,
or transient chit-chat. They represent shared facts, the [data-on-the-outside](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2005/papers/P12.pdf).
As such, services need to take responsibility for curating these shared datasets over time:
fixing errors, handling situations where schemas change etc.
