## Avoid having a single developer maintaining a component

The bus factor is a measurement of the risk resulting from information and capabilities not being shared among team members,
derived from the phrase "in case they get hit by a bus".

The term applies where a team member might create critical components by crafting code that performs well,
but which also is unavailable to other team members, such as work that was undocumented, never shared,
encrypted, obfuscated, unpublished, or otherwise incomprehensible to others.
Thus a key component would be effectively lost as a direct consequence of the absence of that team member,
making the member key.

If this component was key to the project's advancement, the project would stall.
